Hello world, it´s me! 
I´m a on my way to create a design empire! I´m Tereza 22 years old graphic designer working on my career and I think that the good base is a good studying so I´m working on my first bachelor degree and applying for master degree. I found my love to graphic design in printing techniques mostly, so yours wedding annoucement might be really original and authentic with my skills! Don´t really love the digital space but we´re good friends too. And as long as I can breathe your design is safe with me. I dream of having my own graphic studio where we will be making the world simpler and more aesthetic and also learn other people how to do it.
